Data Analytics Projects for CodTech Data Analytics internship.

PROBLEM STATEMENTS:-

1. Big Data Analysis using PySpark:
This task involves working with large datasets using Apache Spark, a distributed computing framework. We are required to load, process, and analyze big data using PySpark's DataFrame API, perform transformations, and extract insights efficiently.

2. Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning (Classification):
In this task, we are building a machine learning model to classify data based on historical patterns. We are preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, training a classifier (such as a Random Forest or Logistic Regression), and evaluating its performance.

3. Interactive Dashboard using Dash:
In this task, we are creating a web-based dashboard using Dash (a Python framework for building interactive applications). The dashboard will visualize data, allow user interactions, and dynamically update charts based on user inputs.

4. Sentiment Analysis using NLP:
The goal of this task is to perform sentiment analysis on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We are using tools like NLTK or TextBlob to determine whether a given text expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
